### Forms of Prayer to be used in Families

#### Morning Prayer

*The Master or Mistress having called together as many of the Family as can conveniently be present, let one of them, or any other who may be appointed, say as follows, all kneeling, and repeating with him the Lord’s Prayer.*

> Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Here may follow the Collect for the day.

**_Acknowledgment of God’s Mercy and Preservation, especially through the Night past._**

> Almighty and everlasting God, in whom we live and move and have our being; We, your needy creatures, give to you our humble praises, for preserving us from the beginning of our lives to this day, and especially for having delivered us from the dangers of the past night. For these your mercies, we bless and magnify your glorious Name; humbly beseeching you to accept this our morning sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; for his sake who lay down in the grave, and rose again for us, your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_Dedication of Soul and Body to God’s Service,
with a Resolution to be growing daily in Goodness._**

> And since it is of your mercy, O gracious Father, that another day is added to our lives; We here dedicate both our souls and our bodies to you and your service, in a sober, righteous, and godly life: in which resolution, do you, O merciful God, confirm and strengthen us; that, as we grow in age, we may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_Prayer for Grace to enable us to perform that Resolution._**

> But, O God, who knows the weakness and corruption of our nature, and the many temptations which we daily meet with; We humbly ask you to have compassion on our infirmities, and to give us the constant assistance of thy Holy Spirit; that we may be effectually restrained from sin, and incited to our duty. Imprint upon our hearts such a dread of thy judgments, and such a grateful sense of your goodness to us, as may make us both afraid and ashamed to offend you. And, above all, keep in our minds a lively remembrance of that great day, in which we must give a strict account of our thoughts, words, and actions to him whom You have appointed the Judge of living and dead, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**_For Grace to guide and keep us the following Day,
and for God’s Blessing on the business of the Same._**

> In particular, we implore your grace and protection for the ensuing day. Keep us temperate in all things, and diligent in our several callings. Grant us patience under our afflictions. Give us grace to be just and upright in all our dealings; quiet and peaceable; full of compassion; and ready to do good to all men, according to our abilities and opportunities. Direct us in all our ways. Defend us from all dangers and adversities; and be graciously pleased to take us, and all who are dear to us, under your fatherly care and protection. These things, and whatever else You shall see to be necessary and convenient to us, we humbly beg, through the merits and mediation of your Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.

> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.

#### Evening Prayer

*The Family being together, a little before bedtime, let the Master or Mistress, or any other who may be appointed, say as follows, all kneeling, and repeating with him the Lord's Prayer.*

> Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Here may follow the Collect for the day.

**_Confession of Sins, with a Prayer for Contrition
and Pardon._**

> Most merciful God, who are of purer eyes than to behold sin, and has promised forgiveness to all those who confess and forsake their sins; We come before You in an humble sense of our own unworthiness, acknowledging our manifold transgressions of your righteous laws. But, O gracious Father, who desires not the death of a sinner, look upon us, we beseech You, in mercy, and forgive us all our transgressions. Make us deeply sensible of the great evil of them; and work in us an hearty contrition; that we may obtain forgiveness at Your hands, who are ever ready to receive humble and penitent sinners; for the sake of Your Son Jesus Christ, our only Saviour and Redeemer. Amen.

**_Prayer for Grace to reform and grow Better._**

> And lest, through our own frailty, or the temptations which encompass us, we be drawn again into sin, grant us, we ask you, the direction and assistance of Yoyr Holy Spirit. Reform whatever is amiss in the temper and disposition of our souls; that no unclean thoughts, unlawful designs, or inordinate desires, may rest there. Purge our hearts from envy, hatred, and malice; that we may never suffer the sun to go down upon our wrath; but may always go to our rest in peace, charity, and good-will, with a conscience void of offence towards You, and towards men; that so we may be preserved pure and blameless, unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_The Intercession._**

> And accept, O Lord, our intercessions for all mankind. Let the light of your Gospel shine upon all nations; and may as many as have received it, live as becomes it. Be gracious unto Your Church; and grant that every member of the same, in his vocation and ministry, may serve You faithfully. Bless all in authority over us; and so rule their hearts and strengthen their hands, that they may punish wickedness and vice, and maintain Your true religion and virtue. Send down Your blessings, temporal and spiritual, upon all our relations, friends, and neighbours. Reward all who have done us good, and pardon all those who have done or wish us evil, and give them repentance and better minds. Be merciful to all who are in any trouble; and You, the God of pity, do administer to them according to their several necessities; for his sake who went about doing good, Your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_The Thanksgiving._**

> To our prayers, O Lord, we join our unfeigned thanks for all Your mercies; for our being, our reason, and all other endowments and faculties of soul and body; for our health, friends, food, and clothing, and all the other comforts and conveniences of life. Above all, we adore Your mercy in sending Your only Son into the world, to redeem us from sin and eternal death, and in giving us the knowledge and sense of our duty towards You. We bless You for Your patience with us, notwithstanding our many and great provocations; for all the directions, assistances, and comforts of Your Holy Spirit; for Your continual care and watchful providence over us through the whole course of our lives; and particularly for the mercies and benefits of the past day; asking You to continue these Your blessings to us, and to give us grace to show our thankfulness in a sincere obedience to His laws, through whose merits and intercession we received them all, Your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_Prayer for God’s Protection through the Night following._**

> In particular, we ask You to continue Your gracious protection to us this night. Defend us from all dangers and mischiefs, and from the fear of them; that we may enjoy such refreshing sleep as may fit us for the duties of the coming day. And grant us grace always to live in such a state that we may never be afraid to die; so that, living and dying, we may be Yours, through the merits and satisfaction of Your Son Christ Jesus, in whose Name we offer up these our imperfect prayers. Amen.

> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
