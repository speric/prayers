### Forms of Prayer to be used in Families

#### Morning Prayer

*The Master or Mistress having called together as many of the Family as can conveniently be present, let one of them, or any other who may be appointed, say as follows, all kneeling, and repeating with him the Lord’s Prayer.*

> Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Here may follow the Collect for the day.

**_Acknowledgment of God’s Mercy and Preservation, especially through the Night past._**

> Almighty and everlasting God, in whom we live and move and have our being; We, your needy creatures, give to you our humble praises, for preserving us from the beginning of our lives to this day, and especially for having delivered us from the dangers of the past night. For these your mercies, we bless and magnify your glorious Name; humbly beseeching you to accept this our morning sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; for his sake who lay down in the grave, and rose again for us, your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_Dedication of Soul and Body to God’s Service,
with a Resolution to be growing daily in Goodness._**

> And since it is of your mercy, O gracious Father, that another day is added to our lives; We here dedicate both our souls and our bodies to you and your service, in a sober, righteous, and godly life: in which resolution, do you, O merciful God, confirm and strengthen us; that, as we grow in age, we may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**_Prayer for Grace to enable us to perform that Resolution._**

> But, O God, who knows the weakness and corruption of our nature, and the many temptations which we daily meet with; We humbly ask you to have compassion on our infirmities, and to give us the constant assistance of thy Holy Spirit; that we may be effectually restrained from sin, and incited to our duty. Imprint upon our hearts such a dread of thy judgments, and such a grateful sense of your goodness to us, as may make us both afraid and ashamed to offend you. And, above all, keep in our minds a lively remembrance of that great day, in which we must give a strict account of our thoughts, words, and actions to him whom You have appointed the Judge of living and dead, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**_For Grace to guide and keep us the following Day,
and for God’s Blessing on the business of the Same._**

> In particular, we implore your grace and protection for the ensuing day. Keep us temperate in all things, and diligent in our several callings. Grant us patience under our afflictions. Give us grace to be just and upright in all our dealings; quiet and peaceable; full of compassion; and ready to do good to all men, according to our abilities and opportunities. Direct us in all our ways. Defend us from all dangers and adversities; and be graciously pleased to take us, and all who are dear to us, under your fatherly care and protection. These things, and whatever else You shall see to be necessary and convenient to us, we humbly beg, through the merits and mediation of your Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.

> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
